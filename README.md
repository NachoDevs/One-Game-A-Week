# One-Game-A-Week

## Description
This is repository to store all my one week games that I will be doing to learn more about game development.
All the projects will be uploaded, the only condition is that they have to be done in one week, it doesn't matter the state of the game.

There is a list later in this document where I show all the project I want to tackle, in no specific order. The thought process is going to be like a game jam, that being:
  1. I select randomly one of the topics.
  2. I start brainstorming how the game can play. I will try not to follow the "norm" unless it is what I want to do.
  3. Work my ass off!!
  4. Once the week has passed, upload and forget about it!
  
This list can, and will, change over time.

## Repository structure
This document is in the main folder of the repository, inside this folder we will find another folder for each project uploaded.

## Technology
I have decided to use Unity as my main development tool, it is capable of doing everything I need, since this are more "prototypes" than fully flesh out games, so no complicated/weird stuff in them.
All projects will also have a trello board (all links below)
